# 漢字勉強 (kanjibenkyō)
This project (lit. "Chinese Character Study" in Japanese) is a Japanese language study application that aims to make your progress on each character or word trackable over time. I plan to add gamification features in the future to further incentivise study. https://kanjibenkyo.com
